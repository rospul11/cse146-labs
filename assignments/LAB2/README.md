# Lab 2

Before beginning, make sure your environment is properly set up.
This is documented in the [README for this repository](../README.md).

In this assignment, you will learn about how to observe and interpret the impact different features have on a machine learning model.
Additionally, you will learn about a real-world controversy with a potnentially biased machine learning model.

For this lab, you will be working in groups of 2-3 people.   You should *each* submit a copy of your code (which can/should be identical) and you should jointly submit one version of the written component of the lab via Canvas.

## Submitting the Assignment

Submit your assignment by running `python3 -m autograder.cli.submission.submit assignment.ipynb` from your local repository directory.
This script will check for your email, password, and assignment id in `config.json`
and submit your work to a server controlled by the TAs where tests will be run, reporting the results back to you.
