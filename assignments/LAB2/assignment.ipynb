    "In the US justice system, before you are sentenced, paroled, or the terms of your bail are set\n",
    "(all steps that may result in incarceration)\n",
    "a judge or committee is supposed to assess your risk for future crime (nonviolent or violent),\n",
    "this act of committing future crime is called **criminal recidivism**.\n",
    "If you are considered low risk you may get more favorable treatment (a lower sentence, early parole, a low bail),\n",
    "but if you are considered high risk then you get the opposite treatment.\n",
    "COMPAS is software that was developed to do this risk assessment instead of humans.\n",

    "you should already be very cautious about a system that decides whether people will spend more time in jail.\n",

    "The nonprofit organization [ProPublica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProPublica)\n",
    "did a [study on COMPAS](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) and found it to be racist.\n",
    "ProPublica found that COMPAS was more likely to incorrectly label black defendants as high risk,\n",
    "and less likely to label white defendants as high risk.\n",
    "In more precise terms, if COMPAS' predictive task was a binary classification where high risk is the positive label,\n",
    "black defendants have a higher false positive rate (FPR)\n",

    "Each row in the data contains information on one individual who was charged with a crime in Broward County as some point in the past.\n",
    "Each data instance contains a number of features (described below) for that individual,\n",
    "and also contains an output value that indicates if that individual went on to recidivate (commit another crime) in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has already been mostly cleaned, transformed, and split for you,\n",
    "and exists in two files:\n",
    "`recidivism-training-data.csv` which contains training data\n",
    "and `recidivism-testing-data.csv` which contains testing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All attributes have been converted into binary features.\n",
    "This generally means that continuous values were binarized with a thresholded\n",
    "(e.g. everything under 0.5 was converted to 0.0 and the rest was converted to 1.0) \n",
    "and non-numeric values were [One-Hot encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-hot).\n",
    "In One-Hot encoding, we take all the possible values an item can take and assign each possible value an index.\n",
    "Presence of that value results in a 1, and absence results in a 0.\n",
    "Essentially, we are turning a list of items into a series of binary columns which ask \"Do you have this value?\".\n",

    "the same ranges/bins of counts as above (namely: 0, 1, 2, >=3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Juvenile \"Other\" Count** --\n",
    "A count of the number of non-felony/non-misdemeanor convictions this individual has as a minor (juvenile).\n",
    "Such \"other\" convictions are less severe than felonies and misdemeanors (i.e., infractions).\n",
    "This feature was also originally an integer value, but was transformed into a feature with four categorical values\n",
    "representing the same ranges/bins of counts as above (namely: 0, 1, 2, >=3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prior Convictions Count** --\n",
    "A count of the total number of prior convictions this individual has had as an adult.\n",
    "This feature was also originally an integer value,\n",
    "but was transformed into a feature with four categorical values representing the same ranges/bins of counts as above (namely: 0, 1, 2, >=3).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Degree of Charge** --\n",
    "The degree of the current charge that this individual is facing.\n",
    "The only possible values for this feature are: \"felony\" or \"misdemeanor\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of Charge** --\n",
    "The type of crime with which the individual is being charged.\n",
    "Originally, this feature had over 400 possible values, but they were consolidated into one of the following 12 high-level categories:\n",
    " - No charge\n",
    " - License issue\n",
    " - Public disturbance\n",
    " - Negligence\n",
    " - Drug-related\n",

    " - Theft/fraud/burglary\n",
    " - Lewdness/prostitution\n",
    " - Violent crimes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Age** --\n",
    "The individual's age at the time of arrest.\n",
    "Originally, this feature was simply an integer value,\n",
    "but for this assignment it was transformed into a feature with three categorical values representing ranges of ages\n",
    "(to match the same age bins used in the ProPublica analysis for this feature).\n",
    "Those age ranges/bins are:\n",
    " - Less than 25 years old\n",
    " - 25 to 45 years old\n",
    " - Greater than 45 years old\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gender** --\n",
    "The individual's gender.\n",
    "To match the COMPAS data, this was artificially restricted to \"female\" and \"male\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Race** --\n",
    "The individual's race.\n",
    "This feature has six values:\n",
    " - Other (i.e., none of the races below)\n",
    " - Asian\n",
    " - Native American\n",
    " - Caucasian (same as \"White\" in the ProPublica analysis)\n",

    "## Part 2: Logistic Regression and Feature Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "[Logistic Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) is a great choice for a first classifier to use when exploring data.\n",
    "Although there will often be better models to use in the end,\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a strong \"all-around\" model that is rarely the worst in practice.\n",
    "Logistic Regression also falls into a family of models called [general linear models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_linear_model),\n",
    "which are easier to interpret than many other families of models (like clustering or non-linear (e.g. neural) models).\n",
    "\n",
    "General linear models work by applying a function to a linear combination of all features before making a prediction:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y}(x, b, w) = f( b + w \\cdot x )\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $ b $ is called the \"bias\" (not to be confused with a ethical/fairness bias),\n",
    "$ w $ is a vector of weights/coefficients (one for each feature),\n",
    "and $ f $ is some function that is applied to the result of the linear combinations.\n",
    "Logistic regression uses the [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) for $ f $.\n",
    "There are a lot of very interesting reasons, benefits, and trade-offs associated with using the logistic function,\n",
    "but those are outside the scope of this course.\n",
    "All we need to know about the logistic function for this lab is that it tends to produce values that are close to either $ 0.0 $ or $ 1.0 $.\n",
    "As we can see below, large values produce a result near $ 1.0 $, and small values produce a result near $ 0.0 $.\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"logistic.png\" style=\"background-color: white\" width=\"500px\"/></center>\n",
    "<center style='font-size: small'>Image courtesy of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Logistic-curve.svg'>Wikimedia Commons</a>.</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of analyzing the logistic function more, what we are really interested in here is $ w $,\n",
    "the vector of weights (one for each feature).\n",
    "As we see above, large inputs into the logistic function produce outputs\n",
    "(in our case these are predictions) close to $ 1.0 $.\n",
    "Therefore if the linear combination of is large, our Logistic Regression model will predict closer to 1 (true).\n",
    "We can also look at it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y}(x, b, w) \\sim \\sum_{i = 1}^{|x|} w_i * x_i\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that after training our Logistic Regression model\n",
    "(which will learn values for $ b $ and $ w $),\n",
    "we can look at the values of $ w $ to see which features our model prioritizes."
